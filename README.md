# sapling

This is my attempt to re-implement a simple version of `tree` in Rust.

This is my first rust program. Wish me luck.

## installation

(assumes you already have cargo installed and your terminal configured to have
cargo-installed executables on your `$PATH`)

```
cargo install sapling
```

## Goals

* [x] get basic tree output
* [ ] style it correctly
* [ ] add tests??
* [ ] respect gitignore if present
